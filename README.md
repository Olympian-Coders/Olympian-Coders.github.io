CS 171 Final Project: Beyond the Podium:
A Century of Performance and Progress

In this project, we aimed ot explore the history of the olympics. 
We first explored the growth of the olympics. We then focused on who 
and what makes up the olympics. Finally, we wanted to dedicate a section to 
representation in the olympics, which we did by focusing on
female representation throughout the years. 

We divided our repository into the following files and folders 
1. css: This folder contains all of the styling used. We used bootstrap and googlefonts. Everything we did in styling could be found in style.css
2. data: This folder contains all of the datasets that we used for this project.   
**maleFemaleandAll_counts.csv** file was used to create the stacked area chart displaying how many male and female olympians there have been throughout the years.  
**result_top_10_teams_per_year.csv** was used to create the bubble chart displaying the countries with the most female olympians
**oly_merged.csv** was used to create the globe visualization that displays the countries participating each year   
**oly.csv** was used for the visual that displays the events that participated throughout the years.  
**womansInfoNew** was used to create the visual that displays the historical female olympians
**medals.csv** was used to display the medals that each country has won   
**countries-50m.json** was used to display the countries for the globe
3. img: This folder contains all of the photos we used for our timeline, meet the authors, and additional images throughout our project
4. js: This folder contains all of js files. We divided this folder into sections that our project focused on. All of the visualizations having to do with the history of the olympics are under history, those having to do with gender are under gender, and those having to do with demographics are under demographics.
We also have a main.js file where we have the global variables, functions and loads the data. 
5. index.html: This is where the layout of our website exists. It calls other supplemental files at 
the end of the document
